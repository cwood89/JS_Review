  <h1>Even More 9</h1>
  <p>
    Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number.
  </p>
  <p>
    After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the game the number of tries needed should be
    printed.
  </p>
  <p> It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
  </p>
  <form>
    <label for="test">Guess a number between 1 and 25: </label>
    <input type="number" name="test">
    <button type="submit">Enter</button>
  </form>
